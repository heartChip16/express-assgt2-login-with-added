				<h2>Work Experience</h2>
				<p>My previous work experiences are actually part of my engineering journey. In engineering I learned to
					be
					analytical, systematic and logical. So I can say that my engineering journey is not in vain when I
					shifted to
					web developement.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="work-description">
						<p>This period is a continuation of Year 1 uC-IC Project of MSU-
							IIT and DOST-PCIEERD. During this period, we (the Project 1 Team assigned for the digital
							part
							of
							the uC-IC,
							while the other
							2 projects being the Energy Harvesting Unit and Power
							Management Unit), performed detailed physical synthesis,
							hardware emulation, Static Timing Analysis (STA), and ICC
							physical design and verification, as well as chip testing of the
							fabricated chip.</p>
						<p>During the course of the period, the researcher was also
							responsible for the power analysis of each of the projects,
							Project 1 (MCU), 2 (Power Management Unit) and 3 (Energy
							Harvesting Unit). She was also responsible for creating the

							involved were RTL design of the microcontroller using Verilog
							HDL, RTL and gate simulation, synthesis, timing analysis and
							equivalence checking using Synopsys tools.</p>
						<p>The researcher was primarily responsible in the processor part
							(frontend, execution unit and other core modules), and its
							verification; initial integration of SRAM verilog model to the
							core; integrated the peripherals GPIO, UART, SPI and I2C to
							the core; RTL and gate simulation of the core with GPIO,
							UART, SPI, and I2C; initial physical synthesis of the core using
							Synopsys ICC; I2C RTL design, RTL and gate simulation,
							synthesis, equivalence checking, and hardware emulation.</p>
